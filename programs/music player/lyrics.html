        Have I ever told you
        I want you to the bone?
        Have I ever called you
        When you are all alone?
        And if I ever forget
        To tell you how I feel
        Listen to me now, babe

        I want you to the bone
        I want you to the bone
        I want you to the bone

        Oh, maybe if you can see
        What I feel through my bones
        And every corner in me, oh
        There's your presence that grown
        Maybe I nurture it more
        By saying how I feel
        But I did mean it before

        I want you to the bone
        I want you to
        Take me home, I'm fallin'
        Love me long, I'm rollin'
        Losing control, body and soul
        Mind too for sure, I'm already yours
        Walk you down, I'm all in
        Hold you tight, you call and
        I'll take control, your body and soul
        Mind too for sure, I'm already yours

        Would that be alright? Yeah
        Hey, would that be alright?
        I want you to the bone, yeah
        So bad I can't breathe, no

        I want you to the bone

        Of all the ones that begged to stay
        I'm still longing for you
        Of all the ones that cried their way
        I'm still waiting on you
        Maybe we seek for something that
        We couldn't ever have
        Maybe we choose the only love
        We know we won't accept
        Or maybe we're taking all the risks
        For something that is real
        'Cause maybe the greatest love of all
        Is who the eyes can't see, yeah

        Take me home, I'm fallin'
        Love me long, I'm rollin'
        Losing control, body and soul
        Mind too for sure, I'm already yours

        Walk you down, I'm all in
        Hold you tight, you call and
        I'll take control, your body and soul
        Mind too for sure, I'm already yours

        Would you just take me home?
        Would you just love me long?

        Should I keep hoping on?
        Should I keep hoping on?

        Could I just take you home?
        Could I just love you long?

        Should I keep hoping on?
        Should I keep hoping on?

        Hey, I want you to the bone
        I want you to the bone, bone
        I want you to the bone, bone, bone, bone
        I want you to the moon and back
