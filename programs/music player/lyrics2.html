        You know me the best
        You know my worst, see me hurt, but you don't judge
        That right there is the scariest feeling
        Opening and closing up again
        I've been hurt, so I don't trust
        Now here we are, staring at the ceiling
        I've said those words before, but it was a lie
        And you deserve to hear them a thousand times
        If all it is is eight letters
        Why is it so hard to say?
        If all it is is eight letters
        Why am I in my own way?
        Why do I pull you close?
        And then ask you for space
        If all it is is eight letters
        Why is it so hard to say?
        Isn't it amazing how almost every line on our hands align?
        When your hand's in mine
        It's like I'm whole again, isn't that a sign?
        I should speak my mind
        I've said those words before, but it was a lie
        And you deserve to hear them a thousand times
        If all it is is eight letters
        Why is it so hard to say?
        If all it is is eight letters
        Why am I in my own way?
        Why do I pull you close?
        And then ask you for space
        If all it is is eight letters
        Why is it so hard to say? (Woah, oh yeah)
        When I close my eyes
        It's you there in my mind
        When I close my eyes
        If all it is is eight letters
        Why is it so hard to say?
        If all it is is eight letters
        Why am I in my own way?
        Why do I pull you close?
        And then ask you for space
        If all it is is eight letters
        Why is it so hard to say?
        If all it is is eight letters
        When I close my eyes
        It's you there in my mind (it's only you)
        When I close my eyes
        If all it is is eight letters
        When I close my eyes
        It's you there in my mind (you)
        When I close my eyes
        If all it is is eight letters
